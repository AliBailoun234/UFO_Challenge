# UFO_Challenge

### Overview of the project
This project is intented to provide an analysis (with tables) of UFO sightings around multiple states in the US. 
The website created as a result of this project allows visitors and users of the website navigate among the data present on the website and filter for multiple criteria (such as city and state) at the same time.

The website helps users to visualize available data on UFO sightings, because without appropriate data and visualization, many things would become useless if it is not properly communicated.

### Results
The webpage created is relatviely simple and easy to follow. There is a filter search bar to the left of the page in order to enhance customer experience and make it easier for users to specify their needs and not go through the whole table to count only a certain element (such as UFO sightings in a state).
